# Welcome to my GitHub website
## About me
I'm a student at Johns Hopkins University. I'm currently a Molecular and Cellular Biology major, but I have a big interest in Biophysics and Computer Science.

## My work (recent)
* **Research Assistant**, Johns Hopkins University [Summer 2017-Present]: I am working on a project relating to neuronal sensing and stress responses in *C. elegans*, using the dauer pathway as a behavioral output. Since the project is new, most of my work has revolved around designing and injecting new constructs in our animals (on top of maintaining, storing, and testing all our existing lines). We also are using PDMS devices for our experiments, so I am (1) optimizing our experimental setup with these devices and (2) coding a program that will calculate behavioral response given our setup. 
* **Course Assistant** [Spring 2017-Present]: I'm a course assistant for Intermediate Programming, an experiential learning C/C++ course in the Computer Science department. This job includes assisting students during class exercises, holding office hours, and grading homework assignments.
* **Research Assistant**, Baylor College of Medicine [Summer 2013-2016]: Over the summers, I designed a "rainbow" mouse model with up to five different fluorescent markers for proteins within the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. I also worked with mice, harvesting them and testing the samples. As a side project, I also developed a protocol for testing our mice for lactose dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDEV), as it interfered with accurate results in other experiments.
