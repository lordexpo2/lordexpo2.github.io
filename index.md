# Welcome to my Github website
## About me
I'm a student at Johns Hopkins University. I'm currently a Molecular and Cellular Biology major, but I have a big interest in Biophysics and Computer Science.

## My work (recent)
* **Course Assistant** [Spring 2017]: I'm a course assistant for our C/C++ course in the Computer Science department. This includes assisting students during class exercises, holding office hours, and grading homework assignments.
* **Research Assistant**, Baylor College of Medicine [Summer 2013-2016]: Over the summers, I would work at Baylor. I worked on making a "rainbow" mouse model with up to five different fluorescent markers for proteins within the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. I also worked with mice, harvesting them and testing the samples. As a side project, I also developed a protocol for testing our mice for lactose dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDEV), as it interfered with accurate results in other experiments.
